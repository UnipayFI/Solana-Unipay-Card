# Unipay-Card Solana

This repository contains the Solana implementation of the **Unipay Card** smart contract. The contract enables users to collateralize SOL to obtain a credit limit, allowing them to open a virtual credit card and add credit for real-world spending.

## Overview

Unipay Card on Solana provides a decentralized solution for users to leverage their SOL holdings to access credit. By staking SOL, users can:

- **Obtain an Initial Credit Limit**: Collateralize your SOL to receive a starting credit line.
- **Open a Virtual Credit Card**: Use your credit line to open a Unipay virtual credit card for everyday purchases.
- **Improve Credit Score**: Enhance your creditworthiness through timely repayments and honest on-chain activity.
- **Access Unsecured Lending**: Eventually unlock unsecured borrowing limits without needing additional collateral.

## Features

- **Collateralized Lending**: Stake your SOL to receive a credit limit on your Unipay virtual credit card.
- **Progressive Unsecured Lending**: Increase your credit score to access unsecured credit lines over time.
- **Credit Scoring System**: Our algorithm evaluates your on-chain behavior to adjust your credit limit.
- **Real-World Spending**: Bridge the gap between crypto assets and everyday expenses with seamless integration.

## Credit Scoring System

Our credit scoring algorithm considers various factors:

- **On-Chain Activity**: Interaction with mainstream protocols and absence of fraudulent behavior.
- **ENS Participation**: Engagement with the Ethereum Name Service.
- **Repayment History**: Track record of timely repayments on your Unipay Card.

This system ensures that only trustworthy users gain higher credit limits and access to unsecured lending.
